# AGnews classification
Classifying news using NLP
News classification from text has exciting real world applications that can be implemented impactfully to leverage user experience through recommendation. We 
use and compare different methods like TF-IDF from sklearn and Tokenizer from keras to transform text data into word vectors. We then use 3 machine learning 
algorithms - Multinomial Naive Bayes, Vanilla (Simple/Plain) Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks to predict a news category for the given input. 
We use accuracy as the performance metrics to evaluate the above models.
